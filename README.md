#Polynomial Calculator

##Overview

The Polynomial Calculator is a C++ project designed to perform various operations on polynomials with rational coefficients. The project includes fundamental arithmetic operations, polynomial transformations, and mathematical computations such as finding roots and applying Euclidean algorithms.

##Features
The calculator supports the following functionalities:  
1.Addition of two polynomials: Computes P(x) + Q(x)
2.Subtraction of two polynomials: Computes P(x) - Q(x)
3.Multiplication of two polynomials: Computes P(x) * Q(x)
4.Division of two polynomials: Computes P(x) / Q(x), where Q(x) ≠ 0 and deg(P) ≥ deg(Q). The program outputs both the quotient and remainder.
5.Multiplication of a polynomial by a rational number
6.Evaluation of a polynomial for a given rational number
7.Finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two polynomials using the Euclidean algorithm
8.Application of Vieta's formulas
9.Representation of a polynomial in terms of powers of (x + a)
10.Factorization of polynomials (if possible) and extraction of all rational roots
11.Implementation Details

The project is implemented in C++.
